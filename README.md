# onLineUp - Mobile app 

Queuing is an important aspect of our daily social lives. And it frequently results in unwanted behaviors such as queue-jumping, jostling,â€¦ caused by long wait times, and people's varying levels of urgency. Furthermore, because of the ongoing epidemic, there is a high risk of catching the Covid-19 virus while queuing.
For the above reasons, we decided to create an application that improves the queueing experience for people, especially during dangerous times such as these.
